# Memory-Game
MS Project 2
## Overview
What is this website and what does it do?
The memory game, which also may be known as, 'Matching Pairs, Match Match or Match Up' used to be and still is a classic physical card game in which all of the cards are laid face down on a surface and two cards are flipped face up over each turn. The object of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards. This game has been taken to the next level by being hosted online so it can be played anywhere, anytime, making it one step easier to train your brain.

## UX
### Strategy
What are the main goals of this site?
•	Make a game that users enjoy playing.
•	Provide a clean, simple, and interactive site which allows users to improve their memory.
User Stories
First Time Visitor Goals
•	As a first time user I need to understand the site/game purpose.
•	As a first time user I want to be able to enjoy playing the memory game.
Returning Visitor Goals
•	As a returning Visitor, I would like to still feel challenged when playing the memory game.
•	As a returning Visitor I would like to improve my memory with the game.
### Scope
There are a few features that will be included in the site.
#### Button
A button will be needed for user to find instructions on how to play the game. The button was chosen so that people can have the option of chosing whether or not they would like to have instruction text or not as there are many people who already know how to play the game.
#### Modal
The modal will appear once the button has been selected. This will help any user that have not played the game before, or would like a slight refresh on how to play the game. Once the instructions have been read, a 'close' button is also available to remove the modal and start playing the game.
#### Alert
There are three occasions in which an alert will appear on the page.
- The first being when a match is found, an alert is triggered and the user is informed that they have found a match.
- When a match has not been found, an alert is triggered and the user is informed that they have not found a match and to try again.
- When they have clicked the same card, an alert is triggered and the user is informed that they have clicked the same card twice.
#### Footer
The footer section includes relevant links to social media sites, this encourages the user to stay connected. Each link will open a new tab allowing for easy navigation and not having to lose anything that may of been saved on the game page.
#### Features Left to Implement
There are a few features that I would like to implement in the future, such as:
- Different games, I would like the site to have a variety of different memory games so that users have a choice in which game they wish to play. The games would also be group together based on what they test, for example, audio tests would all be in one catogory, images test and text test, etc.
