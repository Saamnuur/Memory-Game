# Memory-Game
MS Project 2
## Overview
What is this website and what does it do?
The memory game, which also may be known as, 'Matching Pairs, Match Match or Match Up' used to be and still is a classic physical card game in which all of the cards are laid face down on a surface and two cards are flipped face up over each turn. The object of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards. This game has been taken to the next level by being hosted online so it can be played anywhere, anytime, making it one step easier to train your brain.

A live demo can be found [here]
## UX
### Strategy
What are the main goals of this site?
•	Make a game that users enjoy playing.
•	Provide a clean, simple, and interactive site which allows users to improve their memory.
User Stories
First Time Visitor Goals
•	As a first time user I need to understand the site/game purpose.
•	As a first time user I want to be able to enjoy playing the memory game.
Returning Visitor Goals
•	As a returning Visitor, I would like to still feel challenged when playing the memory game.
•	As a returning Visitor I would like to improve my memory with the game.
### Scope
There are a few features that will be included in the site.
#### Button
A button will be needed for user to find instructions on how to play the game. The button was chosen so that people can have the option of chosing whether or not they would like to have instruction text or not as there are many people who already know how to play the game.
#### Modal
The modal will appear once the button has been selected. This will help any user that have not played the game before, or would like a slight refresh on how to play the game. Once the instructions have been read, a 'close' button is also available to remove the modal and start playing the game.
#### Alert
There are three occasions in which an alert will appear on the page.
- The first being when a match is found, an alert is triggered and the user is informed that they have found a match.
- When a match has not been found, an alert is triggered and the user is informed that they have not found a match and to try again.
- When they have clicked the same card, an alert is triggered and the user is informed that they have clicked the same card twice.
#### Footer
The footer section includes relevant links to social media sites, this encourages the user to stay connected. Each link will open a new tab allowing for easy navigation and not having to lose anything that may of been saved on the game page.
#### Features Left to Implement
There are a few features that I would like to implement in the future, such as:
- Different games, I would like the site to have a variety of different memory games so that users have a choice in which game they wish to play. The games would also be group together based on what they test, for example, audio tests would all be in one catogory, images test and text test, etc.
- Different difficulty levels can also be added, so the images become more and more complex as you go along. 
### Structure
This site currently consists of one page, and is in the following order:
-Title
-Small text
-Button (with modal pop up)
-Score
-Game grid
-Footer
### Skeleton
Before creating the website I did have sketch the page wireframe so that I have a rough idea on how I want my site to lool.

### Surface
#### Colour Scheme
The main theme for the game was very old school, so a mismatch colour scheme was needed to match with the game cards.
#### Typography
The main body text was Raleway with sans-serif as a back up. For the main title, Cinzel was used, with serif as the backup font. Both font styles were obtained from Google fonts, the first font that I chose was the title font and from the few recommended body text suggested to me on the site I felt that Raleway look best.
#### Imagery
The main background image used was a simple board to again match the theme of it being very old school.
For the playing cards, I created the images myself on Paint 3D, having simple images was key.

## Testing
### Deployment
The site is hosted using GitHub pages, deployed directly from the master branch.

I first went to 'my repositories' on GitHub and selected 'New'. From here I added the repository name, kept it as 'Public' and selected 'Add a README file'.
Once the repository was created I opened it via the 'gitpod' button located.
All code for the course was written in GitPod.
Once there has been a new commit and push on GitPod, the GitHub site will automatically update.
To ensure correct deployment, the landing page must be named index.html.
To host my project under GitHub so others can view it and be provided with a shareable URL, on my GitHub page, in the "Settings" tab, I scrolled down to sub section 'Github Pages', I selected "Master Branch" under source and saved.
The code can be run locally by either selecting "clone" which provides an URL one can use on their local machine
